                        <p>Peyton (left) and Jenna (right) led the front-end development of this project, harnessing the power of React JSX to bring it to life. Best friends since middle school, they grew up in Northern Virginia together and made the bold choice to both attend the University of South Carolina. After four years as roommates and many hours of thoughtful deliberation, they’re taking their collaboration to the next level—launching their own web development business post-graduation!</p>
